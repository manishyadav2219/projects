the attached python files :-
-> alexnet.py contains code for alexnet model. One time the model is built on input with image size (227,227) and the other    time it is built on input with image size (77,77).
-> VGG16_and_inception.py contains code for two models. One is for VGG16 and other is for Inception.The image size used is (32,32) to make training process less time consuming.
-> Mymodel.py contains a new model which i have thought of myself and it is a combination of alexnet and inception model.Image size used is (77,77)
-> image_augmentation.py contains code for image augmentation.If u feel the need for applying image augmentation in any of the model in the above three files just add the code into that model.

In all the above models SGD optimiser is used .However u can change it to adam or rmsprop. Also number of epochs for training process are taken as ten to reduce the time taken in traini
